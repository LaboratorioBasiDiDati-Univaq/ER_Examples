# ER_Examples
> Entity Realtionship diagrams developed during the lectures

## Usage

This repository contains the final ER diagrams developed during the lectures and based on the specifications given by the teacher. In particular, each specification *N* corresponds to a folder that contains

- the initial ER diagram *(filename: N_ER)*
- the restructured ER diagram *(filename: N_ER_Ristrutturato)*
- the corresponding relational model *(filename: N_Modello_Relazionale)*


*These examples will be (re)developed approximately during the first ten lectures of the course, so wait to download it, since they may get updated in the meanwhile. Moreover, note that not all the specifications may be shown/(re)developed in each academic year.*
